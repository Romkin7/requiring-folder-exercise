# requiring-folder-exercise

This require whole folder exercises solution that uses `import & export` over `module.exports & require` syntax, that i made for Colt Steele's course 
**The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022**.

In order for this to work file extencions must be mjs not regular js.
And `--experimental-specifier-resolution=node` should be used when running node.

## Execute

```sh
node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node app.mjs
```
